# This is tita robot Head light control service, 
# You can control a total of 48 tail rgb light


# A total of 48 lights can be controlled, 
# and the light efficiency of each light is represented
# by the data structure uint32_t, so you need to use a 
# uint32_t array containing 48 elements

# If you want to control the headlights, set the bool 
# is_control to true, when you give up control, you need 
# to set the bool to false, after which the light effect 
# will be automatically taken over by the software's 
# internal state machine

# rgbl values refer to red, green, 
# blue and brightness 
# for example: light_rgbl_value[0] = 0x12345678
# This means that red is: (0x12U), green is: (0x34U),
# blue is: (0x56U), brightness is: (0x78U)

# Each time you write data, you must complete the 48 
# light effects, because the underlying software will 
# directly update the light effects of 48 light beads 
# at one time
